git 
version control system is a tool that help tp track chnge in code git is  version control system it is 
popular
free @ ioen 
fast #scable

1. track the history
2. collaborate


GitHub 
website that allows developer to store and mange their code using git

http://github.com

folder (repositotries) (repo)


GitHub account 
creat a new repository : aoana college-demo
make our first commit

GIT ME TWO STEP HOTE H CHANGE KARNE KI LIYE ADD AND COMMIT

JO CHANGE KARNA H USE ADD KRO OR COMMIT KARKE USE COMPLETE KRO

LEKIN GITHUB ME DIRECT COMMIT HOTA H SINGLE STEP CHANGES


git se git hub ko bta rhe h ki kya kya chanhes kra h


~ this show in git bash to show to are in a root directory (main folder ke ander hai hum abhi)



to store detail in git (git bash) = first  

1.  git config --gobal user.name "vishalkashyap1155"
2.  git config --gobal user.email "vishalkashyap1155@gmail.com"

to check sotre detail in the in git bash so we write 

3. git config --list

creditail helper
 to store and to detail of our credential detail like our user name user email and name etc


clone and status 
clone - cloning a repository on our local machine

git clone <- some link ->

agar koi GitHub ke code ko local pr copy karne ke liye  git clone ka use karte h

status - display the state of the code 

ls command for list file in git bash in a folder
ls -a se hidden files bhi dekh sakte h


there are four status has to come when we track status of git which are
1. untracked - new file that git dosent yet track
2. modified - changed git status
3. staged - file is ready to be committed (add kar diya )
4. unmodified - unchanged

jab apan koi change ya naya file and karke use add karte h tab add(staged status show hota hai)

or us file ko jab hum commit kar dete hai to wo commit(unchanged status dikha ta hai)

how to add and commit 

add - adds new or changed files in yur working directory to the git staging area.
git add<-file name->
if you add all files than you can do  =   (git add .)

commit - it is the record of change
git commit -m "some message"


now aapna ab ahead ho gye h remote{git hub se }
ye change git hub pr tab tak ni dikhe ga jab tak hum push command apply nhi karate

ab to use push command

push - upload local repo content to remote repo
git push origin main

origin ka matlab h jo hamri default repo h remote pr jisse humne apne code ko clone kiya the to use repo ka nam hi humne origin rhka h hum kuch or naam bhi rak sakte h ye copy ya clone default repo se hua tha to use ka naam origin rkaha

main is our (branch on remote)
jis me humne code ko push kiya h (we learn about branches more in this tutorials )


use git init command to make a new repo for working with git and git hub to initialize

to do work and 

init - used to creat a new git repo

git init

git remote add origin <link>   command where- git remote add and name of that remote repo is origin


and check to get that origin how the command is 

git remote -v and  origin <link>wich one you enter

git branch  (to check branch)

git branch -M main  (to rename branch)

git puch origin main

git push -u origin main (to set upstream )//mean hume dobara yye nhi batana padega ki origin main me change karna h


branch commands

git branch (to check branch)

git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git checkout -b <-new branch name->
git checkout <-branch name-> (to create new branch)
git branch -d <-branch name -> (to delete branch)

merging code
way1
git diff <-branch name->  to compare , brnches , files and  more->
git merge <-branch name -> (to merge 2 branches)


way 2
create a PR

first we talk about PR
pull request 
it lests you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on git hud.

git pull origin main 
isse remote pr jo main me hai wo local pr pull hokar a jayega


resolving merge conflicts
an event that takes place when git is unable to automatically resolve diffetence in code between two commits.


undoing changes

case 1 : staged changes
git reset <-file name->
git reset

case 2: commited changes (for one commit)
git reset HEAD~1

case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
git reset <-commit hash->
git reset --hard <-commit hash->



fork
a fork is a new repository tat shares code and visibility settins with the original "upstream" repository.
fork is a rough copy.
